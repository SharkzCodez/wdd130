    <section class="answer">
        <p>We specialize in more extreme and thrilling rafting experiences. We like to take our guests to areas that have little to no evidence of human activity to give them a wild and wonderful experience they will never forget!</p>
        <p>Due to the intensity and physical demand of our rafting trips, our guests need to be 16+ to attend. However, we do offer summer camps with memorable experiences for younger teens that include rock climbing, canoeing, and fire building, to encourage a love of nature and being in the outdoors.</p>
        <p>Our excursions can last from 3 days to a week (weather pending). The length of our trip depends on how remote the location is, how the weather affects the trip, and how many days we spend rafting.</p>
        <p>You are required to bring your personal items, such as clothes, tolietries, any required medication, and a sleeping bag. We will provide tents, life jackets, food, first aid kits, and other necesities. If you have any dietary restrictions, please let us know in advance so we may work with you to accomodate them.</p>
