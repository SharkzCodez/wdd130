        <h2>Why do we need to protect sharks?</h2>
          <p>While sharks carry a bad reputation of being man-eaters and eating more desirable marine animals such as dolphins, seals, and sea turtles, they are important to the environment and the economy. Some sharks take on a role of apex predator and keep populations in check, while others are scavengers and recyle nutrients. As this keeps the environment healthy, it brings tourists to snorkle, dive, and swim in reefs, therefore benefitting the local economy. Some thrillseekers and shark lovers may decide to go on shark dives or boat tours, meaning sharks can directly impact the economy as well. We are also making advancements in medicine from studying sharks, as their skin and scale structure discourages bacterial growth.</p>
          <h2>So, what can we do to help them?</h2>
          <p>A good start to helping sharks is by educating yourself about them. It will not only make you aware of what threats they face, but you can correct misconceptions about them, as society does not look at them in a favorable light.</p>
