    <p>Hello! My name is Eliza, but I much prefer going by Zsa Zsa. I'm so excited to get to learn to code more!</p>
    <p>I am a younger sister with an older brother. Despite us being two years apart, many people mistake us for twins. Some of my hobbies include drawing, playing video games, playing my instruments, cooking, and voice acting. I recently got a role as a voice actor for an animated series and I'm very excited to work on that.</p>
    <p>I think coding and web development is facinating, and I love learning more about it. I enjoyed programming with Python, and I am excited to see what html and css have to offer me.</p>
    <p>I look forward to getting to know everyone and see how y'all's skills develop over time!</p>
